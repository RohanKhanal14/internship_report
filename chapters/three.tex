\subsection{Description of the Project Involved During Internship}
The system is analyzed using the Object-Oriented Approach, which includes three
aspects. Object Modelling with Class and Object Diagrams shows the static
structure of the system. Dynamic Modelling with State and Sequence Diagrams
explains object interactions and state changes. Process Modelling with Activity
Diagrams illustrates the workflow and control flow of operations.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item \textbf{Class Diagram}
          \begin{center}
              \begin{figure}[H]
                  \centering
                  \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{Images/Highlevel/class.pdf}
                  \caption{Class Diagram}
                  \label{fig:ClassDiagram}
              \end{figure}
          \end{center}
          The class diagram presents the fundamental building blocks of the brain tumor detection system. The User class serves as the central entity representing application users, containing basic authentication and profile information along with methods for login, registration, and profile updates. The Result class captures the outcomes of brain tumor analyses, storing prediction results, confidence scores, and timestamps while providing methods for image analysis and report generation. The MLModel class abstracts the machine learning functionality, encapsulating the model path and class labels with methods for image prediction and preprocessing. The AuthService class handles security operations including token generation, verification, and password hashing. The relationships show that users can have multiple analysis results, results utilize the ML model for predictions, and users interact with the authentication service for security purposes.



    \item \textbf{Object Diagram}
          \begin{center}
              \begin{figure}[H]
                  \centering
                  \includegraphics[width=0.60\linewidth]{Images/Highlevel/object.pdf}
                  \caption{Object Diagram}
                  \label{fig:ObjectDiagram}
              \end{figure}
          \end{center}
          This object diagram illustrates a specific runtime scenario where a user named John has performed brain tumor analyses. The diagram shows concrete instances of the classes, with User object ``12345'' representing John's account information, connected to two Result objects showing actual analysis outcomes -- one detecting a Glioma tumor with 95\% confidence and another showing a Normal scan with 88\% confidence. Both results are linked to the same MLModel instance that has successfully loaded the Keras model file. This snapshot demonstrates how the system maintains relationships between users and their analysis history while sharing the ML model instance across multiple predictions.

          \newpage
    \item \textbf{State Diagram}
          \begin{center}
              \begin{figure}[H]
                  \centering
                  \includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{Images/Highlevel/state.pdf}
                  \caption{State Diagram}
                  \label{fig:StateDiagram}
              \end{figure}
          \end{center}
          The state diagram traces the user journey through the application's main workflow states. Users begin in an unauthenticated state and transition to authenticated status through successful login or registration. Once authenticated, users can navigate to image upload functionality, where they submit brain scan images for analysis. The system then moves to a processing state where the ML model analyzes the uploaded image. Upon completion, users reach the result display state where they can view their analysis outcomes. From this state, users can either initiate new analyses by returning to image upload or generate detailed PDF reports. The diagram also shows the logout transition that returns users to the unauthenticated state, completing the application lifecycle. This workflow represents the essential data flow from image submission to result presentation.


    \item \textbf{Sequence Diagram}
          \begin{center}
              \begin{figure}[H]
                  \centering
                  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Images/Highlevel/sequence.pdf}
                  \caption{Sequence Diagram}
                  \label{fig:SequenceDiagram}
              \end{figure}
          \end{center}
          This sequence diagram depicts the core interaction flow for brain tumor analysis. The process begins when a user uploads a brain scan image through the frontend interface. The frontend forwards this request to the backend server, which first saves the uploaded image to the designated uploads directory. The backend then invokes the ML model service to analyze the saved image, receiving prediction results including tumor classification and confidence scores. These results are subsequently stored in the database for future reference and user history. The backend returns the analysis results to the frontend, which presents them to the user in a comprehensible format. This workflow represents the essential data flow from image submission to result presentation.


    \item \textbf{Activity Diagram} \\
          The activity diagram outlines the decision-based workflow of the application. The process starts with authentication verification, directing unauthenticated users through the login process before proceeding. Once authenticated, users can upload images, which undergo validation to ensure they meet the system requirements for format and size. Valid images proceed to ML model processing, where the deep learning algorithm analyzes the brain scan for tumor detection. Successful analysis results are saved to the database and displayed to users. The workflow includes an optional branch for PDF report generation, allowing users to create downloadable documentation of their analysis results. Error handling is integrated throughout, redirecting users to appropriate error states when validation or processing fails.
