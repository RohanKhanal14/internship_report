\section{Problem Statement}
Brain tumors are among the most critical and life-threatening medical conditions, requiring timely diagnosis for effective treatment and improved survival rates. Conventional diagnostic methods, primarily reliant on manual analysis of \gls{mri} scans by radiologists, are time-consuming, prone to human error, and often lead to inconsistent results, especially in early detection stages. The rising volume of medical imaging data further exacerbates this issue, putting additional strain on healthcare systems. There is a compelling need for an automated, accurate, and efficient system that can assist in detecting and classifying brain tumors to support medical professionals in making informed decisions.\cite{ilic2023}\cite{babu2023}
